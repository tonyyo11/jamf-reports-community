# Changelog <!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable user-visible changes to this project should be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versions in this repository map to git tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed HTML report JavaScript being completely non-functional (dark mode, table sorting,
  search, CSV export all broken). The `_js()` method used a plain triple-quoted Python
  string, causing `\r` and `\n` to be emitted as literal CR/LF bytes inside JavaScript
  regex patterns and string literals, producing a parse error that silently broke the
  entire `<script>` block. Fixed by switching to a raw string (`r"""..."""`).

### Added

- Added **Active Devices** sheet to the jamf-cli workbook showing total, active, and
  inactive device counts against the `thresholds.stale_device_days` window.
- Added adjusted compliance columns to **Patch Compliance**: Adjusted Up To Date,
  Adjusted Out Of Date, Adjusted Total, and Adjusted Completion %. These columns scale
  raw patch counts by the active-device ratio so stale/offline devices don't deflate
  reported compliance. If device-compliance data is unavailable the adjusted columns are
  silently omitted and raw columns remain unchanged.
- Added Jamf School reporting support for `jamf-cli school` data and Jamf School device
  CSV exports.
- Added `school-generate`, `school-collect`, `school-scaffold`, and `school-check`
  commands.
- Added Jamf School workbook sheets for inventory, OS versions, device status, stale
  devices, overview, device groups, users, classes, apps, profiles, and locations.

### Changed

- Extended the config and documentation surface to cover Jamf School mappings and
  workflows.
